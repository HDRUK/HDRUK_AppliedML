## Welcome

Welcome to the git repository for the Oxford Big Data Institute's seminar series on Deep Learning !

We'll be posting links to required readings for each week and uploading course slides, notes, and supporting code.

## Getting Started with Code

- Clone this repo to your machine

- Install conda (https://conda.io/en/latest/), then run the following command from the root directory of the repository:

`conda create -n hdruk_aml python=3.6`

- Now activate your environment:

`conda activate bdi_dl`

- Install the necessary packages:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Note that the requirements file may expand from week to week so if you find yourself lacking packages to run a particular script, just re-run the prior command.
